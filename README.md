VehicleInsight is an ML model designed to analyze vehicle data and extract insights for automotive companies and stakeholders.
It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets and identify patterns and trends in vehicle usage, performance, and maintenance.

The ExtraTreesRegressor algorithm helps the VehicleInsight model to accurately predict vehicle maintenance needs 
and optimize fleet management strategies for automotive companies.
